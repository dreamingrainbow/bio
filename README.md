## Current Projects
Below you can find a few of the projects Michael is working on or was apart of.

### Rickle ###
Rickle A token built to bring decentralized finance to the common person. 

  _Sept 11, 2020_ 
  I was approached by Brent G. and Mike E. to help them start building the Rickle tokenomics and ecosystem. At which time Mike and Brent handed the reigns over to me and said here build it. At this time the project barely had a few wallet holders, mainly friends and family of Mike.
