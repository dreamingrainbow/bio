# Michael A. Dennis AKA dreamingrainbow
Coding dreams to life since 1997

## Introduction
Hello, and greetings. Glad you came to visit. I want to share with you a bit about myself. If there is ever a dream you have and would like it brough to code just let me know what I can do for you.

## History
Back in the 80's when I was barely a kid I was living with my aunt and uncle who had an Apple IIc. I was so intrigued I spent hours just looking over books and magizines about computers and writing code. It wasn't long before I plunged in to Apple Soft Basic to copy the Nibbles game out of the Boy's Life Magazine. Those were the days.

## Growth and Understanding
Through the years I have had a unique oppurtunity to work and grow in the industry. I have spent my entire life studing and working various contract jobs building application with various language.

## Passion and Dedication
You may never find anyone with as much passion and dedication to the computer industry as I find myself. I spend most waking hours lurking on the computer. Be it writing code or socializing with a crypto community I built. (Check it out here https://discord.gg/rickletoken)

## Leadership and Team Execution
To me the most important part of being in a team is communication. If you don't have good communication you wont have a good functional team. In order to promote open communication I thrive on an open door policy. I think any time a team member needs a moment to chat they should have the time made to do so. Each person on the team is just as important as the other. Together, we are the team.

## Skills and Technology
Technology being a vast field and having skills that utilze that technology is an important part of being a developer. Each day I try to stay abreast on new immerging technologies as well as pratice my skills. I spend on average 6 hours a day writing code for one project or another. I spend around 16 hours a day on the computer or involved with the industry in some fashion. Be it teaching others or learning something new for me building my skills never stops at I know that im done. I think learning never stops.

## Most Recent Work
The following are a few of my most recent works. As a full stack developer you will see that I can not only design the from end layout, build the back end server, setup the domain, DNS, or email services, but I can also engineer the entire system from the ground up.

  I was approached by Brent G. and Mike E. to help them start building the Rickle tokenomics and ecosystem. At which time Mike and Brent handed the reigns over to me and said here build it. At this time the project barely had a few wallet holders, mainly friends and family of Mike.
